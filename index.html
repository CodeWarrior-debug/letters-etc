    <h2> New Supplies</h2>
    <p>
     We were able to finish purchasing needed new supplies for the court and the office thanks to a mission
     grant from Grace Church in Greenville, SC. Kids now have a place to sit (other than the floor) when
     hanging out after school or gathering for Bible study! They also have new sports equipment to use
     during practices and games.</p>
