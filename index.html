      <!-- Greetings -->
      <p>Greetings, Team Champions!</p>
      <p>
        Recently a pastor couple from Ciudad Sandino, Nicaragua came to visit
        Greenville, SC for a few days to participate in an activity at our
        church before going to check in with a number of their supporting
        congregations in various parts of the US. While they were here, we took
        them out to breakfast one morning. Several of the youth that attend
        their church in Ciudad Sandino participate in Champions for Jesus, and
        the pastors remarked on how Champions has come to be a well-known and
        well respected ministry in the community. It was special to hear those
        words coming from other spiritual leaders in the community where we are
        at work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are a few highlights from the last few months that we’d like to
        share with you:
      </p>
      <!-- New Supplies -->
      <h2>New Supplies</h2>
      <p>
        We were able to finish purchasing needed new supplies for the court and
        the office thanks to a mission grant from Grace Church in Greenville,
        SC. Kids now have a place to sit (other than the floor) when hanging out
        after school or gathering for Bible study! They also have new sports
        equipment to use during practices and games. Take a look!
      </p>

          id="one"
          alt="Two kids playing connect four on table."
        />
        <img
        id="two"

        />
      </div>

      <!-- New Participants -->
      <h2>New Participants</h2>
      <p>
        At the beginning of this year, we had an influx of young participants
        (under 12). We estimate that more than half of these new participants in
        Ciudad Sandino (our original and primary location) have stayed with us
        throughout the year. Not quite two years ago, we started a second
        Champions Academy in a neighborhood called Los Brasiles, and our program
        there has also continued to grow: there are about 60 children
        consistently participating in weekly activities, and the majority of
        these are plugged in at local churches.
      </p>

      <!-- Recent Achievements -->
      <h2>Recent Achievements</h2>
      <p>
        In my last letter, I shared about the successes of several of our teams
        during national championships this year. Shortly following my letter,
        Luis Pavón, the president of the Nicaraguan national basketball
        federation (Fenibalón) who thought highly of Champions and was a
        supportive connection in many ways, unexpectedly suffered a series of
        strokes and later passed away. In the months that followed, there was a
        pause in basketball tournaments and events on the national level as the
        organization worked to identify a new president and regroup. Our Field
        Manager, Klaimer Duarte, was offered the position but turned it down
        because he said he prefers his current job! We’re grateful he loves what
        he does!
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, municipal tournaments (all of Ciudad Sandino) continued to
        take place, and our girls’ U19 team were champions for the third
        consecutive year. For the boys, our U14 team won first place, and the
        U15 and U18 teams won second place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another exciting development has been to observe several older Champions
        participants developing leadership qualities as they lead younger teams
        during practices, games, and Bible studies. These “captains” are also
        helping manage communication among their peers regarding reminders for
        practices, games, and special events, visiting their teammates at home
        to check on them if they miss a practice, etc.
      </p>

      <!-- Raising Up Leaders -->
      <h2>Raising Up Leaders</h2>
      <p>
          It is amazing to see how, over the last decade, Champions has developed
          young leaders who are now being recognized and sought for external
          leadership opportunities. As previously mentioned, Klaimer was sought to
          fill the position of president of Nicaragua’s national basketball
          federation but declined (luckily for us!).
        </p>
        <div class="bigpic">
          <img src="./assets/images/everybody_by_office.png" alt="Numerous rising youth leaders standing in front of the Champions HQ.">
        </div>
      <p>
        Ismael, who grew up in Champions and now works on staff half-time to
        provide the same programming for younger individuals, was offered a post
        as Basketball Coordinator for the mayor’s office of Ciudad Sandino.
        Ismael also declined because he wanted to continue working in his
        current role with Champions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, Alejandro Chávez Picado was hired for the position with the
        office of the mayor; he, too, is a graduate of Champions programs with a
        desire to give back to his community. What a testimony that young men
        growing up in and graduating from Champions Academy as well as leaders
        of this well-respected ministry are so recognized for their character
        and experience that they are sought for leadership opportunities locally
        and nationally!
      </p>

      <!-- In Their Words -->
      <h2>In Their Words</h2>

      <blockquote>
        “When I first came to Champions, I was an undisciplined person. I didn’t
        like to follow orders, and I always wanted to do what I wanted. Klaimer
        invited me to train for a U-18 competition, and I was a disaster: I
        didn’t attend practices, and I was undisciplined and disrespectful. In
        the end, Klaimer decided not to take me to the competition.
        <br />
        <br />
        “After that, there came another tournament. I did everything possible in
        order to be able to go.<span class="emphasis"> I started to change my life, and beginning in
        that moment I began to be more disciplined and to take opportunities
        more seriously. </span> Champions and the coaches gave me another opportunity,
        and it was the best thing I could have done.
        <br />
        <br />
        “For me, Champions is my second family. I think that if I had not gotten
        involved in Champions, my life would have been completely different and
        I would have made wrong choices. <span class="emphasis"> Now, thanks to the formation that
        Champions for Jesus gave me in basketball as well as moral and spiritual
        values and to the references of Klaimer and the coaches, I obtained a
        job </span> as Director and Coordinator of Basketball for the mayor’s office of
        Ciudad Sandino.”
      </blockquote>

        ><span class="parentheses"> (father of Ian)</span>
        <br />
      </div>

      <blockquote>
        “ <span class="emphasis">I began getting more involved in my son’s games and the activities
        they do in Champions. As a result, I now have a close relationship with
        my son. </span> Champions gave me an opportunity as a father to get to know my
        son better. I am proud of the person that my son is becoming thanks to
        Champions.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        For context on William's quote, Ian is a student in Champions Academy. He has been
        participating in the Academy for almost four years. Now, as one of the
        team captains and a volunteer in Champions, Ian is an example for
        younger children.
      </p>
      <p>
        In one of the national tournaments where we emerged victorious, Ian’s
        father, William was very proud of his son and told us that he was very
        thankful that Champions had given his son this opportunity. He said that
        since Ian began participating in Champions, things began to change in
        his son’s life. William felt that his relationship with his son had not
        been a very close one, but he could see how being in Champions was
        changing his son’s character for the better:

      <h2>Thank You!</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you so much for being a part of this work. It takes all of us
        together to provide the enriching recreational, educational, relational,
        and spiritual resources and experiences that have come to make Champions
        stand out in the Ciudad Sandino community as well as in the lives of the
        boys and girls who come back for more week after week.
